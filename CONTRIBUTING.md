</div>

üéâ To begin, thank you for considering contributing to FastJ! üéâ

This project has been growing well on its own, but with the addition of new features and enhancements we're going to need to work together as much as possible. 

If you'd like to contribute, please read the following:

## Setup

First, we need to clone the Github repo to your computer. Open up your terminal, and run this command in the directory of your choice:

```
git clone git@github.com:mariogarridopt/lofi-girl-cli.git
```

Next, go into that directory:

```
cd lofi-girl-cli
```

And install all the dependencies in the world...

```
npm install
```

Great üåà! You've setup and installed all of lofi-girl-cli dependencies.

## Development environment

To start the application run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

Fantastic ‚úåÔ∏è! You've got lofi-girl-cli up and running on your computer.

## Code editor

You can use **whatever code editor you like**! We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Git branch

Create a new `git` branch for your work. You can call it whatever you like (the more descriptive of your work, the better):

```
git checkout -b strong-component
```

## Its coding time

Make your changes and commit them to your new branch.

## Submitting for review / Create a pull request

After checking in all of your wonderful changes to your `strong-component` git branch. Push it up to [Github](https://github.com/mariogarridopt/lofi-girl-cli).

[Create a new pull request](https://github.com/mariogarridopt/lofi-girl-cli/compare) against the `master` branch!

## Description and labels

Be descriptive of your changes! The more the better. If possible, include screenshots or GIF demos. Add the [appropriate label(s)](https://github.com/mariogarridopt/lofi-girl-cli/labels) that describe your changes.

Since we're adding a brand new component, we'll add the `feature` label.

## High five
üôå Yay! We did it. We walked throug the entire process...

Thank you so much for sticking through this guide.

Hope you have a fantastic day ‚ù§Ô∏è!
